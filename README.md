 # LinguaNet: A Neural Network Based Language Identification System

 ## Project Overview
 LinguaNet is a language identification model built on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using Python and TensorFlow. It employs character n-grams to classify the language of any given text input. The system is capable of ingesting user inputs and efficiently outputting the identified language.

 This project includes the visualization of learned features using techniques such as t-SNE and PCA to give insights into how the network differentiates between languages. The model has demonstrated a final accuracy of 89.2%, illustrating its effectiveness in language identification.

 ## Model
 The model is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) implemented using Python and TensorFlow. It utilizes character n-grams to create distinct feature sets for different languages, and these features are used to classify the language of a given text input.

 To gain insights into the feature representation, we visualized the learned features of the model using techniques such as t-SNE and PCA.

 ## Performance
 The LinguaNet model achieved a final accuracy of 89.2%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying and differentiating languages based on text input.

 ## Future Work
 We plan to refine the model further, aiming to increase its accuracy and expand its scope to include more languages. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
